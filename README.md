## Distributional Models of Semantics ##

Distributional Models for lexical substitution task

Different distributional models were built in order to replace the target word with a substitute that preserves the meaning of the sentence.

- build the freguency space
- build the TF-iDF space
- compute cosine similarity between two word-vectors
- build the word2vec model
- build the LDA model 
- define the multiplication, addition functions between word-vectors
